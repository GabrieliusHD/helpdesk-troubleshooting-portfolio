# My Troubleshooting Approach

When a user reports that something "does not work", I try to avoid guessing
and instead narrow the problem step by step.

## How I Start
- Clarify what exactly is not working
- Ask when the issue started
- Check if the problem affects one user or multiple users
- Confirm if anything changed recently

## First Checks
- Verify basic settings and connections
- Restart the affected service or device if appropriate
- Try to reproduce the issue if possible

## Narrowing the Issue
If basic steps do not resolve the problem:
- I rule out the operating system
- Then check the application
- Then check the device or network side

## When I Stop and Escalate
- If the issue is outside my access level
- If hardware or network configuration is required
- If repeated attempts do not change the result

## Why This Matters
Following a structured approach helps avoid unnecessary actions,
reduces downtime, and makes escalation clearer for higher-level support.
